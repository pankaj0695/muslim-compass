            <strong>What is Muslim Compass?</strong>
            <br />
            Muslim Compass is a community-driven platform that provides
            information on local events, jobs, blogs, and resources for the
            Muslim community.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How do I sign up for Muslim Compass?</strong>
            <br />
            You can sign up using your Google account. Simply click on the
            "Login" button, select your Google account, and you'll be logged in
            securely.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Do I need to create a separate username and password?
            </strong>
            <br />
            No, Muslim Compass uses Google authentication, so you do not need to
            create a separate password. Your Google account manages your login
            credentials.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How do I log in?</strong>
            <br />
            Click on the "Sign in with Google" button, and choose the Google
            account associated with your Muslim Compass profile.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>What if I forget my password?</strong>
            <br />
            Since Muslim Compass uses Google authentication, you don't need to
            reset your password here. If you have trouble logging in, reset your
            Google account password via
            <a
              href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery"

            </a>
            .
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How do I post an event, job, or blog?</strong>
            <br />
            Once logged in with Google, navigate to the relevant section
            (Events, Jobs, Blogs) and click on the "Post New" button. Fill in
            the necessary details and submit your entry.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How can I edit or delete my post?</strong>
            <br />
            Log in with Google, go to "My Posts," select the post you want to
            edit or delete, and follow the instructions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why was my post removed?</strong>
            <br />
            Posts may be removed if they violate community guidelines, contain
            inappropriate content, or receive multiple user reports. If you
            believe this was a mistake, contact our support team.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Is Muslim Compass free to use?</strong>
            <br />
            Yes! Posting and browsing information on Muslim Compass is free.
            However, certain premium features (such as highlighted job postings)
            may have a small fee.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How do I report inappropriate content?</strong>
            <br />
            Click on the "Report" button next to the post and provide details.
            Our team will review the report and take appropriate action.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>How can I log out?</strong>
            <br />
            Click on your profile icon and select "Log Out." You will be logged
            out of Muslim Compass.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Can I log in with a different Google account?</strong>
            <br />
            Yes! Log out first, then click "Login" and choose a different Google
            account.
          </p>
